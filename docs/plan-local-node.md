# Plan: VPS + local machines ("local node")

**Owner's goal (2026-11-11):** one Tucano, synced across Windows, Mac and phone, on the VPS (vsn-vps). Agents can't lose any local operation:

- creative apps (Premiere, Figma desktop, Adobe)
- terminal and repos (git, builds, Jaques OS)
- files and folders
- logged-in browser

That holds on **both machines**. With a machine off, the agent **does what it can** and says what was left pending. Autonomy and approvals **stay as they are today**.

## The idea in one line

Each computer becomes a **connector** of the VPS's Tucano: the "Windows do Jaques" node and the "Mac do Jaques" node. The local app exposes the machine's capabilities as MCP tools on a private address (Tailscale). The VPS calls them like any connector, with the classes, approvals, steps and logos that already exist.

```
 Phone / Mac / Windows ──(sync UI)──▶  Tucano on the VPS (core, database, agents, routines)
                                            │  connector "Windows do Jaques"   (Tailscale, key)
                                            │  connector "Mac do Jaques"
                                            ▼
                          Local Tucano app (node) ─ terminal · lent folders · apps · browser
                                                 └ proxy of the local connectors (premiere-pro, figma-desktop…)
```

Why this is cheaper and safer than a "remote core":

- It reuses everything the VPS already does with connectors: tool classes (read/write/sensitive), approvals in the chat, "always allow", grants per agent, steps with progress, error messages.
- Machine off = connector unreachable. The core already reports "the connector isn't connected", and the agent moves on with what it can, which is the "do what it can" behavior. Missing piece: the agent's prompt should name the nodes and what each one does.
- Nothing new is open on the internet: the node listens only on the Tailscale network, with a key per node.

## What the node exposes (MCP tools)

| Family | Tools | Comes from (already exists) | Class |
|---|---|---|---|
| Terminal | `rodar(comando, pasta)` | `computer.ts` (the "mac" kind: runs as the user) | via `shellActions` (read → write → sensitive), as today |
| Files | `ler`, `escrever`, `listar`, `buscar` in **lent folders** | `local-paths.ts` and lent folders | read / write |
| Apps | `app_ver`, `app_clicar`, `app_escrever`, `app_tecla` | `apps.ts` (agent-desktop) | as today |
| Browser | `navegador_*` | `browser.ts` (Chrome with the node's own profile, logins kept) | as today |
| Local connectors | the tools of `premiere-pro`, `figma-desktop`, Jaques OS… | `ConnectorManager` on the local app | each connector's own class |

"Logged-in browser": it's the node's Chrome profile. You sign in to sites there once, through Take over, and the logins stay.

## Pieces to build

1. **Node server in the local app** (core): an MCP HTTP server built on `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, already a dependency. It's on/off under Settings › This computer as a node. It listens on the Tailscale address only, with a bearer key per VPS. It lists the tools above and runs each one with the existing modules.
2. **Pairing:** a "Connect this computer to the server" button generates the key and registers the node on the VPS as a remote connector (URL `https://<machine>.<tailnet>.ts.net/node`, auth token). It reuses the pairing flow from Settings › Servers.
3. **On the VPS:** a node connector carries a `node` kind and a computer logo. In the agent's page, under "Where it works", you pick which nodes it uses. The prompt says "you have the Windows and Mac computers; if one is off, do what you can and say what's left".
4. **Local connectors through the node:** the node proxies the local app's connectors (premiere-pro, figma-desktop…) as its own tools, prefixed per connector. This avoids reconfiguring them on the VPS.
5. **Offline:** a node call while the machine is off returns a clear error ("the Windows computer is off"), the step shows it, and the agent goes on. Phase 2: an optional queue ("try again when it comes online").

## Phases

| Phase | Delivers | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Tucano server on the VPS + Windows data migrated + apps connected (sync) | hours (needs SSH permission) |
| 1 | Node with **terminal + files** + pairing + offline | ~1–2 days |
| 2 | **Local connectors** through the node (Premiere, Figma desktop, Jaques OS) | ~1 day |
| 3 | **Apps and browser** through the node | ~1–2 days |
| 4 | Queue for when the machine is off; "where it works" choice per agent | ~1 day |

Each phase ships with tests and is used for real before the next one.

## Risks and decisions

- **Security:** the VPS's agents run commands on your computer. Mitigations: Tailscale only (never the internet), a key per node that can be revoked, the same autonomy and approvals as today, a log of every command in the steps.
- **Two machines with the same tool:** each node has its own name, and the agent picks by description ("Premiere is on Windows").
- **Upstream:** this is a feature of the fork. It may go to eduwxyz/tucano later, as a PR, if it makes sense.
- **The first `claude` on the VPS** has to be signed in by you once (Settings › Models › Sign in).
